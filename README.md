Picture-to-ASCII
================

This Python script will take in a picture and convert it to ASCII art.

When you run the script, it will ask you to input the name of the image.  Then it will ask you to put in a number between 0.5 and 4.0 to adjust the contrast.  You can actually put in any number, but those are the recommended values.  By typing 1.0, the contrast will not be adjusted.  Anything above 1.0 will boost the contrast, and anything below will flatten it.  It may take a couple of tries to make the image acceptable.

This is a pretty simple script, and I tried to make it easy to follw.  Feel free to edit/use it however you want.  Something you may want to change is the height/width of the ascii art.  Currently, it is set to resize the width to 150 and height to 250 characters when the picture is in portrait mode.  If it is in landscape mode, the size will not be adjusted.  This size looks great on my monitor, but it may be too large on others.  Just remember that the smaller the resolution, the worse the ascii art will look.

Enjoy!
