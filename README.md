Picture-to-ASCII
================

This Python script will take in a picture and convert it to ASCII art.

When you run the script, it will ask you to input the name of the image.  Then it will ask you to put in a number between 0.5 and 4.0 to adjust the contrast.  You can actually put in any number, but those are the recommended values.  By typing 1.0, the contrast will not be adjusted.  Anything above 1.0 will boost the contrast, and anything below will flatten it.  It may take a couple of tries to make the image acceptable.

This is a pretty simple script, and I tried to make it easy to follw.  Feel free to edit/use it however you want.
